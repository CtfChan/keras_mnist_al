# Keras MNIST Active Learning

This repo contains some of the code that was used as part of my undergraduate thesis "Active Learning for Deep Object Detection". Code was adapted from [bnajasim's Deep-Bayesian-Active-Learning repository](https://github.com/bnjasim/Deep-Bayesian-Active-Learning)

## Running Experiments
```
bash generate_plots.bash
python3 plot_acc.py # visualize performance
python3 analysis.py # generate table for latex document
```
